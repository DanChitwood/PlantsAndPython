# Plants & Python

**Welcome to HRT891A: Foundation in Computational Plant Science!**

This course brings together plant biologists and data scientists to learn fundamental concepts in plant science using a computational mindset.

**This course assumes no prior experience in plant biology or coding**. It is impossible to teach the breadth of introductory plant biology and data science in a single semester. Rather, this course selects specific examples in which mathematical and modeling approaches intersect with the biology of plants.

Coding and plant biology can be intimidating to those with no prior experience. This course is designed to make these disciplines welcoming. **A diversity of perspectives is vital to combat the grandest challanges of our time and there is no room for gate-keeping and shaming: Your contributions to the comptuational plant science community are needed and precious.** This course is meant as an introduction, for you to **develop *your* skills** to **pursue *your* intended impacts**. There are no wrong answers: use this material in whatever way is useful for you to further your education and career. Share this material with others in the same spirit and spread your knowledge.

***Above all, find joy in the way mathematics and modeling can reveal the underlying beauty of plants!***

If you are new to Jupyter and Python, read the [download instructions](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DanChitwood/PlantsAndPython/blob/master/PlantsAndPython0_GettingStartedWithJupyter.ipynb) or watch the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDHRKQl_Pq8) on getting started.
